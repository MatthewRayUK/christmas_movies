                        I started learning Python about 18 months ago, and right from the start, I knew this
                        was something I was going to enjoy. After 13 years as a primary school teacher, I had never explored
                        what the tech industry had to offer. Little did I know how much I would love the process of learning to
                        code!

                        In April this year, I made the leap and left teaching to pursue a career as a Data Analyst, which I
                        absolutely love. With more free time than I’ve ever had in my adult life (if you think teachers work
                        9-3, please, please talk to a teacher!), I’ve been able to dive deeper into coding. While I’m not sure
                        exactly where this journey will take me, I’m enjoying every step of the way.

                        We all love Christmas, don’t we? In my family, my sister and I are particularly obsessed. So, we wanted
                        a fun way to track the movies we want to watch during December—ideally one each day as we count down to
                        Christmas.

                        As I learned more about APIs and Flask, I started brainstorming how to structure this idea and began
                        putting together a few pages. Below, I’ll outline the development of this project and will continue to
                        update it as I make progress.

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Choosing Libraries:</strong> I began by selecting the libraries that would support me in Python. Flask is the main framework I’m using, alongside SQLAlchemy for database management, Flask-Bootstrap to help with HTML & CSS styling, and Flask-WTF to make handling forms a lot easier.</li>
                        <li><strong>Setting Up Databases & Pages:</strong> The setup of the database and basic pages/navigation was straightforward, though I had to dive into Jinja (Flask’s templating engine) to embed Python code within my HTML documents.</li>
                        <li><strong>API Integration:</strong> TheMovieDB API was the perfect resource for retrieving movie information. I set up an account and integrated it to allow users to search for films and fetch their details for the watchlist.</li>
                        <li><strong>User Management:</strong> One of the most fun and educational parts of this project was learning about password security. I loved diving into hashing and salting passwords to keep user data safe, and I’ve implemented this securely within the app.</li>
